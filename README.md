  <summary><h2>Unity project installation</h2></summary>

1. Clone the repo somewhere in your machine.
2. [Download the entire project][drive] in `.zip` format.  
   Make sure to get the version from Raphoulefou, aka the blue circle.
4. Extract the project to the cloned repo on your machine
5. If windows tells you if you want to replace some files, say **NO**. Github files are the newest.

Finally, you can go to Unity hub and add the project, and then work on it. Using your IDE should work too.
